# React + Vite
A simple and intuitive ToDo app built with [React/JavaScript/etc.] that helps you manage your tasks efficiently. This project allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark items as completed. It's a perfect app for organizing daily activities.

âœ¨ Features:
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your ToDo list.
Edit Tasks: Update existing tasks to reflect changes or new details.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need from your list.
Mark as Completed: Check off tasks that are done, moving them to a separate "Completed" section.
Responsive UI: Works across different devices for easy task management on the go.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
